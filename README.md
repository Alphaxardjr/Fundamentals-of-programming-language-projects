# Fundamentals-of-programming-language-projects
Welcome to the Fundamentals of Programming Languages Portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of various projects completed during the course, including individual assignments and group projects.

# About the Course
The Fundamentals of Programming Languages course provides a comprehensive introduction to the core concepts and principles underlying programming languages. Through a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical exercises, Throught this course I have gaine insights into different programming paradigms, language structures, and implementation techniques.

# Individual projects
## **Project 1: Area Calculator**
The "Area Calculator" project can be implemented in multiple programming languages, including C++, Python, and C#. Each implementation follows a similar logic.
The program prompts the user to choose a shape for which they want to calculate the area. Currently supported shapes include; Triangle, Circle and Rectangle.

### **Project Files.**

[C# File](https://github.com/Alphaxardjr/Fundamentals-of-programming-language-projects/blob/a9f8f861d4e0396274b3276b5d788f870c57d1a9/Area%20Calculator/calculator.cs)
[C++ File](https://github.com/Alphaxardjr/Fundamentals-of-programming-language-projects/blob/a9f8f861d4e0396274b3276b5d788f870c57d1a9/Area%20Calculator/calculator.cpp)

### **Usage**
To use the Area Calculator, simply run the respective implementation file (calculator.cpp, calculator.py, or calculator.cs) using a compatible compiler or interpreter. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose a shape and input the required dimensions.

## **Project 2: Grade system**
This code implements a simple grade system that converts numerical scores into letter grades. It defines grade boundaries and their corresponding letter grades, allowing users to input scores and receive immediate grading feedback. The system ensures input validity and provides continuous execution until the user chooses to exit.

## Project 3: **Logic programming**
### Prolog family tree
This Prolog knowledge base defines gender assignments and parent-child relationships within a family. It includes predicates to determine mothers, fathers, siblings, brothers, and sisters based on the defined relationships. Users can query the database to obtain information about family members and their relationships.

# GROUP PROJECT
## Login Interfaces
This group project consists of three Python files that serve as login interfaces, each implemented using different programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and procedural.
The project aims to explore various programming paradigms by implementing the same functionality, i.e., a login interface, using different approaches. By comparing and contrasting the implementations, the group aims to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each paradigm in the context of this specific application.

## Project Files
[Functional File](https://github.com/Alphaxardjr/Fundamentals-of-programming-language-projects/blob/a9f8f861d4e0396274b3276b5d788f870c57d1a9/Login%20interface/functional.py)
[OOP File](https://github.com/Alphaxardjr/Fundamentals-of-programming-language-projects/blob/a9f8f861d4e0396274b3276b5d788f870c57d1a9/Login%20interface/oop.py)
[Procedural File](https://github.com/Alphaxardjr/Fundamentals-of-programming-language-projects/blob/a9f8f861d4e0396274b3276b5d788f870c57d1a9/Login%20interface/procedural.py)

## Usage.
Users can explore the different implementations to understand how the login interface works under different programming paradigms. Each file provides a unique perspective on how to structure and design such an interface.
